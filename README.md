# GraspTools
A collection of tools for the program GRASP developed by me

## clistgen.py

Creates a clist.ref file from the rcsfmr.inp multireference file provided

## orbital optimisation

A bash script that automates much of the DF layer optimisation for you, with many functions such as nuclear decrease mode and creating screened hydrogenic functions to reestimate orbitals.

## nodecounter.py

Counts the number of nodes and difference from correct node from a GRASP octave file

## conf from rcsf py

Prints and outputs a list of configuration files from an rcsf.out file.
Each configuration list is sorted to ensure the same configurations will appear for different CSF files.

## conf collector

Uses the rcsfpreview program developed by me in https://github.com/Joseph-33/Grasp that will estimate the number of CSFs. Useful for very very large expansions.
